			<p>2018 is UTRA’s first year hosting this event. Following UTRA’s mission - to foster creativity and innovation, and cultivate science and technology leaders of the future by providing students with the opportunities to design and build advanced robotic technologies. The team started planning for this event with a mindset of “Design, Build, Inspire”. Without limitation on the design scope, we believe this event could bring a variety of brilliant ideas and creative minds together. 25 hours of hacking is a short time for a fully functional and manufacturable product, but ideas and prototypes are always where future technologies start at. </p>
			<br><br>
			<p>In this event, student teams are required to build a physical prototype within the given time, then pitch to the judges. Judging of the event is based on a few criterias including functionality, innovativity, and most importantly, real-world potential.</p>
